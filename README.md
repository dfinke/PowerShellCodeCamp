PowerShell Code Camp Demos
==
You can also check out the PowerShell source (<a href="https://github.com/dfinke/powershell-for-developers" target="_blank">HERE</a>) I wrote for my book <a href="https://http://www.amazon.com/Windows-PowerShell-Developers-Douglas-Finke/dp/1449322700" target="_blank">"PowerShell for Developers"</a>.

How to run
-
1. Click the `Download zip` button and then unzip. Then:

		cd demo
		.\start-demo.ps1

If you want to see the PowerShell itself, open `demo.txt` in any editor.

Some of the demos require PowerShell v3.0 and the demo that opens `CSHarp-PowerShellDemo.sln` requires Visual Studio to be installed.

Questions
-
Please use the `Issues` forum if you run into trouble.
